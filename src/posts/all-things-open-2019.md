The keynotes from the All Things Open 2019 had a distinguished focus on diversity and inclusion within the tech community.  While the rhetoric was around open source software and their communities, I believe the same principles can be applied to any SaaS company.  I’m going to share some of the conversations which resonated with me the most.

### How do we move people from casual to core contributors?

One of the most interesting tidbits I took away from the conference is the idea that there are three different stages of contribution and what that means for a person in each of those stages.  These stages were mapped specifically to open source contributors, so for the purposes of this reflection I’m going to alter the stages a bit.

### Casual (New Contributor/Employee, < 6 months ish)

A person in this stage requires mentoring.  It’s important for them to see early contribution, both to build confidence and interest in the project.  For a new software developer it could be something like time to first commit (I’m coining this TTFC).  This person is a sponge and is constantly absorbing information from folks in the other stages - this is critical because a casual contributor (or new employee) may lose interest if not engaged by those with more experience.

### Regular (1 year - ...)

This is the stage where contributors start to build confidence.  You may not need as much assistance in taking a task from start to finish, and you often have strong relationships with those on your team.  At this point you most likely have strong expectations for yourself, as well as from other people.  This is often where imposter syndrome starts to set in - you may realize that what you know is less than what you don’t know, so handling the expectations for yourself may become challenging.

### Core (There’s really no time frame for when someone enters this stage)

A core contributor is someone with expert domain knowledge, most likely coming from years of experience within the regular stage.  But perhaps more important than the domain knowledge is to facilitate movement from casual into regular, and from regular into core.  One of the ways of doing this is by building empathetic leaders within the community, within your team, and company wide.  By being an empathetic mentor, those who you mentor will eventually mentor others.

This brings me to my favorite statement from the conference, which I have paraphrased.

>“Light someone elses torch so that the light can spread.  This does not diminish your torch, but rather lights the room for others.” - Kent C. Dodds

### Building an inclusive culture
When the topic of diversity and inclusion is discussed, many people will think of race, gender, or religion.  And while those are most definitely a core piece, diversity also extends to personalities and character traits.  There were some interesting ideas on ways to improve meetings around this discussion.

1.  Send out the meeting agenda ahead of time
Some people may require more preparation, and giving someone the chance to prepare notes ahead of time will make sure that they are engaged in conversation.

2. Rotate who runs meetings
This could be as simple as switching who is running a monthly retrospective within a team, or a weekly planning session.

3. Bounce an idea off someone new
Maybe someone has a great idea, but isn’t confident enough to speak up (see “Casual” stage above).  We encourage people to speak their minds, but sometimes people may need someone to light their torch.

### Final Thoughts
The ATO conference was the first tech conference I’ve attended.  I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the talent of the speakers and the messages they shared.  Another take away I had was to come more prepared with a plan.  With the amount of people and vendors present, networking and finding the right people to talk shop with was a little bit intimidating.  Doing a bit of research ahead of time on who will be there in order to have some thoughts prepared might serve me better in the future.  I suppose ATO will be the first conference to join my list of must-attend!
